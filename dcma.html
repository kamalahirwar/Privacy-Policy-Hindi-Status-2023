    <p>Protection of intellectual property is of utmost importance to us and we ask our users and their authorized
        agents to do the same. It is our policy to expeditiously respond to clear notifications of alleged copyright
        infringement that comply with the United States Digital Millennium Copyright Act (&#8220;DMCA&#8221;) of 1998,
        the text of which can be found at the U.S. Copyright Office <a href="https://www.copyright.gov" target="_blank"

    <strong id="what-to-consider-before-submitting-a-copyright-complaint">What to consider before submitting a copyright
        complaint</strong>
    <p>Before submitting a copyright complaint to us, consider whether the use could be considered fair use. Fair use
        states that brief excerpts of copyrighted material may, under certain circumstances, be quoted verbatim for
        purposes such as criticism, news reporting, teaching, and research, without the need for permission from or
        payment to the copyright holder. If you have considered fair use, and you still wish to continue with a
        copyright complaint, you may want to first reach out to the user in question to see if you can resolve the
        matter directly with the user.</p>
    <p>Please note that if you are unsure whether the material you are reporting is in fact infringing, you may wish to
        contact an attorney before filing a notification with us.</p>
    <p>The DMCA requires you to provide your personal information in the copyright infringement notification. If you are
        concerned about the privacy of your personal information, you may wish to <a
            href="https://www.copyrighted.com/professional-takedowns" target="_blank">hire an agent</a> to report
        infringing material for you.</p>
    <strong id="notifications-of-infringement">Notifications of infringement</strong>
    <p>If you are a copyright owner or an agent thereof, and you believe that any material available on our Services
        infringes your copyrights, then you may submit a written copyright infringement notification
        (&#8220;Notification&#8221;) using the contact details below pursuant to the DMCA. All such Notifications must
        comply with the DMCA requirements. You may refer to a <a
            href="https://www.websitepolicies.com/create/dmca-takedown-notice" target="_blank">DMCA takedown notice
            generator</a> or other similar services to avoid making mistake and ensure compliance of your Notification.
    </p>
    <p>Filing a DMCA complaint is the start of a pre-defined legal process. Your complaint will be reviewed for
        accuracy, validity, and completeness. If your complaint has satisfied these requirements, our response may
        include the removal or restriction of access to allegedly infringing material as well as a permanent termination
        of repeat infringers&#8217; accounts.</p>
    <p>If we remove or restrict access to materials or terminate an account in response to a Notification of alleged
        infringement, we will make a good faith effort to contact the affected user with information concerning the
        removal or restriction of access, along with instructions for filing a counter-notification.</p>
    <p>Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in any portion of this Policy, the Operator reserves the right
        to take no action upon receipt of a DMCA copyright infringement notification if it fails to comply with all the
        requirements of the DMCA for such notifications.</p>
    <strong id="counter-notifications">Counter-notifications</strong>
    <p>A user who receives a copyright infringement Notification may make a counter-Notification pursuant to sections
        512(g)(2) and (3) of the US Copyright Act. If you receive a copyright infringement Notification, it means that
        the material described in the Notification has been removed from our Services or access to the material has been
        restricted. Please take the time to read through the Notification, which includes information on the
        Notification we received. To file a counter-notification with us, you must provide a written communication
        compliant with the DMCA requirements.</p>
    <p>Please note that if you are not sure whether certain material infringes the copyrights of others or that the
        material or activity was removed or restricted by mistake or misidentification, you may wish to contact an
        attorney before filing a counter-notification.</p>
    <p>Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in any portion of this Policy, the Operator reserves the right
        to take no action upon receipt of a counter-notification. If we receive a counter-notification that complies
        with the terms of 17 U.S.C. ยง 512(g), we may forward it to the person who filed the original Notification.</p>
    <strong id="changes-and-amendments">Changes and amendments</strong>
    <p>We reserve the right to modify this Policy or its terms related to the Mobile Application and Services at any
        time at our discretion. When we do, we will post a notification in the Mobile Application. We may also provide
        notice to you in other ways at our discretion, such as through the contact information you have provided.</p>
    <p>An updated version of this Policy will be effective immediately upon the posting of the revised Policy unless
        otherwise specified. Your continued use of the Mobile Application and Services after the effective date of the
        revised Policy (or such other act specified at that time) will constitute your consent to those changes.</p>
